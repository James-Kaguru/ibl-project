## Overview

### 1 Project Background and Description

Having noted an increase in the number of people working remotely. It came to my attention that one key item to ensure that people are able to work well is a productivity app that helps both employer and employees to track their personal tasks and assigned tasks. having a good knowledge of what tasks need to be done ensures that the work can be completed on time. This is especially true for remote work since there is little supervision from the employer when the employee is at home.
As a result, I came up with a solution that will aid with this, which is the task app.

### 2 Project Scope

In order to implement the above requirements I will implement a three tier system. I will comprise of the
* Database - this will include a postgres database
* Backend - this will include an api
* Frontend - this will include a responsive website that works well on both laptops and mobile phones . It will also have mobile app to enable easier accessibility
The system is not only meant to be used in work scenarios but also for personal use for those people who may wish to keep track of their tasks in an orderly manner.
